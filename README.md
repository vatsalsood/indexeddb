# indexeddb
1) Make sure node and npm are installed on your machine
2) cd to the project directory "cd ./indexeddb/indexeddb"
3) run npm install to make sure all the node modules are installed
4) run npm start in the project directory
5) Create DB - This will create a database called `test` in IndexedDB with 2 object stores - `personal_notes` and `todo_notes`
6) Add notes -  We can add rows into the table in this mode. After adding an entry, hit `Add note`. We can add multiple notes. After typing in each entry, click `Add note`. When you are done adding notes, you can click on `Save Notes` and this will add all the notes you added to the table.
7) View/Remove Notes - This will give a table view of all the notes stored in the database. You can also delete entries by clicking on close button
8) The comments and the extra code left is just trial and efforts. Not usually left behind :)
